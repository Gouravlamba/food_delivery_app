## 🔄 App Workflow

**1️⃣ Home Screen**  
- Displays list of restaurants or food categories.  
- User selects a restaurant.

**2️⃣ Menu Screen**  
- Displays dishes of selected restaurant.  
- Each item has name, price, and “Add to Cart” button.

**3️⃣ Cart Screen**  
- Shows added items, quantity, and total amount.  
- User can increase/decrease quantity or remove items.

**4️⃣ Order Summary / Checkout Screen**  
- Displays total order details and final confirmation.  
- User can “Place Order”.

**5️⃣ Order Confirmation Screen**  
- Shows “Order Successful” message and summary.  

All navigation and state changes are handled using **BLoC** and **Events/States**.

- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class has a single, clear purpose.  
- **Dependency Inversion:** Business logic depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations.  
- **BLoC** separates presentation and logic cleanly.

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling
- All API or repository operations wrapped with `try-catch`  
- UI shows SnackBars or AlertDialogs on errors  
- Loading and empty states handled via BLoC states:  
  - `LoadingState`, `LoadedState`, `ErrorState`, `EmptyState`

---

## 🧪 Unit Testing
Located inside `/test` directory.

**Example tests:**
- `cart_bloc_test.dart` – verifies adding/removing items  
- `order_bloc_test.dart` – tests order placement logic  
- Uses `flutter_test` and `mockito` for mocking repositories
